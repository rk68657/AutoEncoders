# AutoEncoders
Relational Autoencoder is implementation on the basis of paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03145
Infrence: There are two component in the loss one is reconstruction error and other is relational error as i have demonstrated on very limited dataset
the reconstruction error while giving high alphas is going pretty high which means am getting a kind of tradeoff between relational and reconstruction error.
You can see that if we giving some alphas value in the lower or latent dimension we certainly are able to distinguish response of same behaviour
here in my example red and green where as when alpha was 0 we aint getting that seperation.
